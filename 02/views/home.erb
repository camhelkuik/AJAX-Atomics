<h1>AJAX Atomics - 02</h1>

<script type="text/javascript" src="/global.js"></script>

<h2>What is the difference between this atomic and the first atomic?</h2>
<p>One differene between this atomic and the first is that /path1 and /path2 are written in the app.rb file and not in text documents inside the public file. Another difference is that /path1 just returns a string where as /path2 takes you to an erb file. </p>
